### Why does it only work with ct_weather.csv? 
1. This is my first project, so there are many examples of stinky codes, not following convention, and no tests.
2. ct_weather.csv has some weird format and missing data that I had to designed my program uniquely for it.

### What so weird about ct_weather.csv?
In a normal csv file (especially one for weather data), there should be number or string values separated by commas.
Well, **ct_weather.csv** decided to make all its values strings even the numbers.
